# Amodh's TODO

This is fork of [Fabio's work](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-todo-plus). I struggled getting it to build with current technologies, so I will be rewriting it. It will have less dependencies, typescript support, and better documentation. Later on, I will be adding pause and resuming behavior, the main feature I want.
