# VSCode Todo+

This is fork of [Fabio's work](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-todo-plus). I struggled getting it to build with current technologies, so I will be rewriting it. I plan on rewriting the project to be cleaner: such as less depdencies, typescript support, and better documentation. Later on,
I will be adding pause and resuming behavior, the main feature I want.
